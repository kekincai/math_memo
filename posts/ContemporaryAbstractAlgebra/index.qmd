Well Ordering Principle
: Every nonempty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.

Greatest Common Divisor, Relatively Prime Integers
: The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers a and b is the largest of all common divisors of a and b. We denote this integer by gcd(a, b). When gcd(a, b) = 1, we say a and b are relatively prime.
